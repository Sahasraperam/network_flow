# Network Flow Algorithms: Analysis, Optimization, and Applications

## 📜 Introduction

Network flow algorithms are fundamental in optimizing resource distribution across networks, with applications in transportation, telecommunications, and supply chain management. This project analyzes existing network flow algorithms, evaluates their efficiency and scalability, and explores optimal approaches for improved performance in complex networks.

## 🎯 Problem Description

Existing network flow algorithms face challenges such as:
- High time complexity in large networks
- Inefficient path selection leading to suboptimal flows
- Scalability issues in dynamic networks
- Non-termination problems with irrational capacities

These limitations impact critical areas like telecommunications, transportation routing, and network bandwidth management.

Our goal is to analyze, implement, and optimize network flow algorithms to enhance efficiency, reduce computational overhead, and optimally route flow in real-time network applications.

## 📊 Algorithm Analysis

### Existing Algorithms:

1️⃣ **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**
   - Uses augmenting paths to increase flow
   - Simple implementation but potentially inefficient path selection

2️⃣ **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**
   - Implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS for shortest augmenting paths
   - Guarantees polynomial time complexity

3️⃣ **Dinic's Algorithm**
   - Uses level graphs and blocking flows
   - Significantly faster for dense networks

### Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Features |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Ford-Fulkerson | O(E·f*) | O(V+E) | May not terminate with irrational capacities |
| Edmonds-Karp | O(V·E²) | O(V+E) | Guaranteed termination, polynomial time |
| Almost-Linear Time (Kyng et al.) | O(m^(1+o(1))) | O(m) | Theoretical optimum, uses novel interior point method |

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

We propose a hybrid approach combining elements of Edmonds-Karp, Dinic's algorithm, and concepts from Kyng's almost-linear time algorithm:

- Use BFS for shortest path finding
- Incorporate level graphs for faster augmenting path identification
- Implement a simplified version of energy optimization for large networks

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. Network Modeling: Represent the problem as a flow network
2. Algorithm Selection: Choose appropriate algorithm based on network characteristics
3. Initialization: Set initial flow values
4. Flow Augmentation: Apply the chosen algorithm's approach
5. Termination Check: Stop when maximum flow is reached
6. Solution Extraction: Extract flow values for each edge

## 🖥️ Expected Output

```
Network with 6 nodes and 10 edges
Source: 0, Sink: 5
Edge (0,1) carries 12 units of flow out of capacity 16
...
Maximum flow: 23 units
```

## 📐 Complexity Analysis

Our hybrid algorithm aims for a time complexity of O(V·E), more efficient than Edmonds-Karp's O(V·E²) for many practical networks.

## 📚 Applications

- Telecommunications Networks: Optimizing data routing
- Transportation Systems: Managing urban traffic flow
- Supply Chain Management: Optimizing product distribution
- Power Grid Management: Balancing electricity distribution
- Water Distribution Networks: Efficient water delivery

## ✅ Conclusion

Our proposed hybrid network flow algorithm improves speed, accuracy, and scalability over existing techniques. Future work will focus on implementing more elements from Kyng's almost-linear time algorithm and developing specialized variants for dynamic networks.
